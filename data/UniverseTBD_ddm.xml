Mayer &amp; Kazantzidis 2008).</sentence><sentence>After the initial asymmetric black hole injection following the ﬁ- nal merger of the galactic cores, the dynamical friction from the gaseous background dominates the one due to the stellar background and makes the black hole separation falls from 100 pc to a few parsecs in less than 10 Myr, in qualita- tively good agreement with Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) results.</sentence><sentence>In- deed in the reference simulation adopting a polytropic equa- tion of state with Γd = 7/5, the mass, size and typical den- sity of the nuclear disk that arises (respectively, ∼ 109M⊙ and 60 pc) are extremely close to those of the nuclear disk in Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007), as is its characteristic temperature.</sentence><sentence>These properties are also consistent with observed nuclear regions in ULIRGs.</sentence><sentence>Being embedded in a background with density and temperature similar to that in the Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) calculations, the pair of SMBHs sinks by dynamical friction very rapidly after the merger, and becomes bound also at a similar separation, about 6 pc.</sentence><sentence>We have also run two lower resolution simulations with diﬀerent polytropic in- dexes, one with Γd = 7/5 as in the reference run and another one with Γd = 5/3; the comparison shows the same trend found by Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007), namely that with a stiﬀer EOS (Γd = 5/3) the orbital decay is slower, both because the decay regime is more subsonic and because the gaseous background has a lower characteristic density, both eﬀects going in the direction of reducing dynamical friction.</sentence><sentence>At a closer inspection, there are however some diﬀer- ences between the SPH nuclear disks of Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) and that in the new RAMSES simulations presented in this paper.</sentence><sentence>First, the disk in the SPH simulations displayed a stronger spiral structure since its appearance, as a result of a higher central surface density and thus a stronger self- gravity (the Toomre parameter was close to 1.5 while ⩾ 2.0 in our disk, see top row of ﬁg.</sentence><sentence>2).</sentence><sentence>The stronger spiral modes lead to a more eﬀective transfer of angular momentum and thus a continuously increasing central density.</sentence><sentence>Second, the level of non-thermal motions in the gas, usually termed ”tur- bulence”, was a factor of about 3 higher than in the RAMSES run (∼ 100 km/s instead of 30−40 km/s), likely as a result of the stronger self-gravitating response.</sentence><sentence>The reason for these diﬀerences are not clear.</sentence><sentence>The higher numerical viscosity in the SPH runs, due to the use of explicit Monaghan artiﬁcial viscosity, especially the quadratic term in shock dissipation during the merger, is expected to dissipate gas motions into thermal energy.</sentence><sentence>This would damp the turbulence faster, at odds with the higher turbulence seen in the SPH simulation, but would also generate viscous transport of angular mo- mentum, leading to an increase in central density and there- fore a higher susceptibility to gravitoturbulence, at least in the innermost region.</sentence><sentence>Another possible cause of the diﬀer- ence is the fact that in the GASOLINE runs of Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) the energy equation was solved, including shock dis- sipation via artiﬁcial viscosity, possibly producing a nuclear disk with lower entropy immediately after the merger rela- tive to the RAMSES runs adopting a ﬁxed polytropic equation of state which does not account, by construction, for entropy dissipation in shocks.</sentence><sentence>Finally, as we explain below, resolu- tion in SPH and AMR runs is not guaranteed to be identical even if the setup is designed to be as close as possible as in the case that we are discussing.</sentence><sentence>4.2 Resolving the drag force and the associated wake The exact timescale of the sinking of the SMBH binary is however dependent on resolution, as was also noticed in Mayer &amp; Kazantzidis (2008), in particular becomes shorter for increasing resolution.</sentence><sentence>At higher resolution the dynami- cal friction wake is better resolved as density gradients are better captured, this being a likely reason behind the faster dynamical friction timescale (Weinberg 1986).</sentence><sentence>In collision- less systems, an analogous resolution dependence of dynam- ical friction, mediated by gravitational softening, has been reported extensively in the literature (White et al.</sentence><sentence>1983; Weinberg 1989; Colpi et al.</sentence><sentence>1999).</sentence><sentence>The formation of a front shock and a trailing hydrodynamical wake which exerts a gravitational drag on the black hole, the so called dynamical friction wake, is a remarkable result of our RAMSES simula- tions.</sentence><sentence>The RAMSES simulations presented in this paper are indeed the ﬁrst that allow to capture the wake of dynami- cal friction very clearly in a highly dynamic situation such as that of a nuclear disk arising from merging galaxies.</sentence><sentence>We show that this gravitational drag is due to overdense gas within 2−3 pc behind the black hole and that the eﬃciency of the hydrodynamical friction peaks at transonic regime, in fair agreement with the analytical prediction from Ostriker (1999), with a Coulomb logarithm close to our resolution limit, suggesting that the dynamical friction wake structure is not fully converged.</sentence><sentence>Our RAMSES simulations, owing to the aggressive re- ﬁnement enabled by the AMR technique, allow to reach a spatial resolution of 0.1 pc in the center of the disk where Hydrodynamics of galaxy mergers with SMBHs 9 the SMBHs are sinking, which is ten times better than the nominal resolution in Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007).</sentence><sentence>We caution, how- ever, that comparing the resolution in AMR and SPH is not straightforward.</sentence><sentence>In particular, in the SPH simulations of Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) and Mayer &amp; Kazantzidis (2008), we adopted a ﬁxed gravitational softening in the high resolution region after particle splitting, which can thus be considered the actual limit of spatial resolution in those calculations (the SPH smoothing length being smaller in high density regions due to the large number of particles employed).</sentence><sentence>In RAMSES the gravitational force resolution is not ﬁxed, rather it is tied to the cell size, therefore it shrinks as the reﬁne- ment is applied to the cells , a situation more reminiscent of what happens with SPH codes adopting an adaptive soft- ening length (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Bate &amp; Burkert 1997).</sentence><sentence>We note that, in Mayer &amp; Kazantzidis (2008), a run was presented with a maximum spatial resolution (in terms of gravitational soft- ening) comparable to the highest resolution simulation pre- sented here.</sentence><sentence>Although the simulation was carried out only for a few orbits after the black holes have formed a binary, rather than for many orbits as in the RAMSES simulations presented here, in both cases the separation of the SMBHs appears to ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly, with no clear signs of sus- tained decay below parsec separation.</sentence><sentence>4.3</sentence></section>

    <sentence>Below such separation it is expected that dynamical fric- tion will become ineﬃcient because the mass of the gaseous background enclosed within the orbit of the two SMBHs becomes smaller than the mass of the SMBH binary.</sentence><sentence>In ad- dition, in the innermost 5 pc of the nuclear disk, the sound speed reaches ∼ 300 km/s, a subsonic regime for the mo- tion of SMBHs, which also implies an ineﬃcient dynamical friction.</sentence><sentence>In polytropic equilibrium models of nuclear disks, Escala et al.</sentence><sentence>(2004) reported an asymmetric torque due to an

colder gas disk than ours.</sentence><sentence>On the other hand, a colder disk could act against the decay in two ways, namely by driving a stronger mass inﬂow by gravitational torques that steepens the cen- tral density on a dynamical timescale and might thus evac- uate the gas around the black hole binary, or might provide more favourable conditions for the opening of a gap by the binary after it has become bound.</sentence><sentence>Finally, it is important to note that binary decay stalls around 2−3 pc, a separation at which the orbital evolution might not be correctly captured with only ∼ 20 AMR cells.</sentence><sentence>A similar resolution problem, as well as possible associated issues with orbit integration accuracy, might have been present also in the previous SPH calculations.</sentence><sentence>Our ﬁndings thus suggest that, as in the case of purely stellar backgrounds, a continued decay towards the gravita- tional wave regime is not automatically achieved in a gaseous background.</sentence><sentence>However, concluding that there is a last parsec problem in gaseous backgrounds is highly premature.</sentence><sentence>First of all, while the strength of our models, relative to other studies adopting idealized nuclear disks, relies in the realis- tic disk conditions inherited by the galaxy merger, there are still several important simpliﬁcations and omissions in the physics at play.</sentence><sentence>First, as in Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>(2007) and Mayer &amp; Kazantzidis (2008), we considered a single phase medium described by an eﬀective EOS.</sentence><sentence>In reality the nuclear disk will host a complex multi-phase ISM, with possibly a highly in- homogeneous density structure (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Wada &amp; Norman 2001).</sentence><sentence>Star formation and supernovae feedback will provide both diﬀuse and localized heating sources, and if the black holes are active as AGNs during one or more phases of the merger they would likely change the initial conditions of the nu- clear disk arising after the merger (i.e.</sentence><sentence>change its density and thermal structure, both being crucial for dynamical fric- tion).</sentence><sentence>Ongoing work with a new multi-phase ISM, star for- mation and feedback scheme, for the moment implemented only in GASOLINE , will soon provide a clue on the impor- tance of such complexity in the sinking rate of the SMBH binary (Roskar et al., in preparation).</sentence><sentence>Furthermore, allow- ing for star formation to happen in the nuclear disk, another missing ingredient, will have an impact since stars can aid the decay in regions where the gas becomes ineﬃcient, as long as stars move on suﬃciently non circular orbit with re- spect to the frame of the binary, in order to keep the loss cone continuously ﬁlled (Preto &amp; Amaro-Seoane 2010; Khan et al.</sentence><sentence>2011).</sentence><sentence>Indeed in a massive self-gravitating disk such as the one obtained here, stars would likely exhibit centrophilic orbits as a result of non-axisymmetric instabilities.</sentence><sentence>One can image thus a multi-stage decay, in which gas is the leading drag source down to parsec scales, owing to its very eﬃ- cient action demonstrated here (Mayer et al.</sentence><sentence>2007), and stars might take over at smaller separations.</sentence><sentence>Future calculations capable of capturing both a realistic multi-phase gaseous medium and the full stellar dynamical response including three-body interactions between the binary and the stars at small scales mark the necessary next frontier that will be needed to progress further in understanding the shrinking of SMBH binaries well below parsec scales.</sentence><sentence>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was granted access to the HPC resources of C.C.R.T.</sentence><sentence>under the allocation 2010(1)-SAP2191 made by GENCI (Grand ´Equipement
