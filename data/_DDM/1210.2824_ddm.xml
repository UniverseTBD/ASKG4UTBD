  <sentence>The thick disk of our Galaxy has been exten- sively studied (especially in the solar neighbor- hood) since it was discovered by Gilmore &amp; Reid (1983).</sentence><sentence>Photometric and spectroscopic studies have shown that it is a distinct component in a number of ways.</sentence><sentence>Juri´c et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) ﬁnd that the stellar number density distribution of dwarf stars in the Galactic disk found using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data and a photometric parallax method is well ﬁt with a two-component exponen- tial.</sentence><sentence>The thick disk component is also known to have both a rotational lag and a larger velocity dis- persion than the thin disk (Chiba &amp; Beers 2000; Soubiran et al.</sentence><sentence>2003) giving it a distinct kinematic signature.</sentence><sentence>It has further been shown to be the dominant component for stars with vertical dis- tances of 1 &lt; |Z| &lt; 3 kpc from the Galactic plane (Allende Prieto et al.</sentence><sentence>2006).</sentence><sentence>The metallicity distribution of the thick disk is still an unresolved issue, however.</sentence><sentence>Using the metallicity and kinematics of SDSS stars, Ivezi´c et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) are able to reproduce the re- sults of previous works, but also caution that there are problems with describing their data using a two-component exponential.</sentence><sentence>Most importantly, they suggest that the metallicity and velocity dis- tributions can be used to describe a single disk component instead of two separate ones.</sentence><sentence>This would suggest a complex nature to a single disk component and not two distinct disk components with diﬀerent formations and evolutions.</sentence><sentence>More re- 1 cently, Bovy et al.</sentence><sentence>(2012) also ﬁnd that the Galac- tic disk can be represented by a single exponen- tial in the radial and vertical directions that is smoothly varying as a function of age (by proxy using abundances).</sentence><sentence>This has naturally lead to several compet- ing theories as to the formation mechanism of the thick disk and how it relates to the thin disk.</sentence><sentence>For example, the thick disk could be mainly composed of accreted stars from previ- ous mergers (Abadi et al.</sentence><sentence>2003), composed of stars formed from accreted gas from previous mergers (Brook et al.</sentence><sentence>2004), or from the inter- nal mixing of stars and gas within the Galaxy (Sch¨onrich &amp; Binney 2009).</sentence><sentence>These are just a few of the various internal and external sources from which the thick disk of our Galaxy could arise.</sentence><sentence>Obviously, a combination of some or all of these scenarios could also give rise to our current Galactic hierarchy.</sentence><sentence>Certain well-deﬁned proper- ties of the thick disk should be able to distinguish between these possible scenarios and provide a clearer picture of the formation and evolution of our Galactic disk.</sentence><sentence>In the radial direction, metallicity gradients vary from ∼0 dex kpc−1 (Allende Prieto et al.</sentence><sentence>2006) to +0.028 ± 0.036 dex kpc−1 (Nordstr¨om et al.</sentence><sentence>2004) for stars likely to be thick disk members.</sentence><sentence>We note that the former uses spectroscopically derived stellar parameters of F- and G-type stars observed by SDSS in the range 1 &lt; |Z| &lt; 3 kpc while the latter uses photometrically derived stel- lar parameters of nearby F- and G-type stars.</sentence><sentence>Re- cent results from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE, Steinmetz et al.</sentence><sentence>2006) fall within these two values (Ruchti et al.</sentence><sentence>2011; Co¸skuno˘glu et al.</sentence><sentence>2012).</sentence><sentence>Vertical metallicity gradients of the thick disk show more discrepancy.</sentence><sentence>Allende Prieto et al.</sentence><sentence>(2006) found no variation of metallicity as a func- tion of vertical height.</sentence><sentence>Using SDSS Red Horizontal Branch stars, Chen et al.</sentence><sentence>(2011) found a gradient as high as –0.22 ± 0.07 dex kpc−1 but this re- sult most likely suﬀered contamination from other Galactic sources.</sentence><sentence>Again, the RAVE results fall somewhere in the middle (Kordopatis et al.</sentence><sentence>2011; Ruchti et al.</sentence><sentence>2011) as do the results of Katz et al.</sentence><sentence>(2011) who observed stars along two diﬀerent lines of sight.</sentence><sentence>Our aim in this work is to examine both ra- dial and vertical metallicity gradients of stars as- sociated with the thick disk of our Galaxy.</sentence><sentence>We use the large sample of spectroscopically observed stars from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Under- standing and Exploration (SEGUE) made avail- able in SDSS Data Release 8 (DR8).</sentence><sentence>Selecting dwarf stars in this analysis is important since it is the dominant component of the disk of our Galaxy.</sentence><sentence>Furthermore, these stars have changed very little since their formation, making them an excellent probe of the condition of our Galaxy during the formation of its disk.</sentence><sentence>We employ various tech- niques used by previous analyses in order to more easily compare results from diﬀerent sets of data and using diﬀerent selection criteria.</sentence><sentence>The large sample of stars with reliable parameter determi- nations facilitates this comparison and allows us to give a more comprehensive view of the metal- licity distribution of stars up to several kiloparsecs above or below the Galactic plane.</sentence><sentence>2.</sentence></section>

    <heading>Data</heading>
  <sentence>Spectroscopic data from SDSS DR8 (Aihara et al.</sentence><sentence>2011) was obtained from the CasJobs interface.</sentence><sentence>The improvement in DR8 for high-metallicity stars is important for this work since we expect many stars to have abundances near or slightly below solar.</sentence><sentence>We used the segue1 target1 ﬂag to select F, G, and K dwarfs (integer values of –2147483136, –2147221504, and –2147450880, respectively).</sentence><sentence>We require that the stars have clean photometry and reasonable spectroscopic parameters (wide cuts were applied to eliminate any undetermined or extreme values for the eﬀective temperature, sur- face gravity, metallicity and radial velocity).</sentence><sentence>This leaves us with 66,481 out of the total 88,081 stars for these three categories.</sentence><sentence>Further cuts were ap- plied to ensure a clean sample of dwarf stars with good quality observed values and are summarized in Table 1.</sentence><sentence>Our ﬁnal sample is 43,417 F, G, and K dwarf stars (slightly less than half the full sample) that have well deﬁned photometric and spectro- scopic values as well as reasonable proper motions.</sentence><sentence>In Figure 1 we show the spatial distribution of our dwarf star sample using distances calculated as described below.</sentence><sentence>The most stringent cut for our dwarf sample is on the surface gravity since we want a sam- ple free of possible turnoﬀ or giant stars to aid 2 Table 1: Selection cuts for our data.</sentence><sentence>Category SDSS Criteria Stars Our Criteria F/G g &lt;

  <sentence>The cuts described in the previous section were applied to provide a sample of dwarf stars that could be used to isolate likely members of the disk component(s) of our Galaxy.</sentence><sentence>As was described in Section 1, past studies have used various methods to select and characterize the disk.</sentence><sentence>We restrict our samples to 7.0 &lt;
