    <sentence>We adopt the outcomes of run E by M12 as initial condi- tions for the simulations presented in this paper.</sentence><sentence>In particu- lar, M12 performed N-body/SPH simulations of a gas cloud evolving in the potential of a M• = 3.5×106 M⊙ SMBH and a stellar cusp as described in Eq.</sentence><sentence>1.</sentence><sentence>The impact parameter of the cloud with respect to the SMBH is 10−2 pc and the ini- tial velocity is close to the escape velocity from the SMBH at the initial distance (25 pc).</sentence><sentence>The cloud is quite massive (1.3 × 105 M⊙), initially spherical (with a radius of 15 pc), marginally self-bound and seeded with supersonic turbulent velocities.</sentence><sentence>The thermodynamic treatment in run E includes radiative cooling with accurate recipes for opacity (Boley 2009) and an irradiation temperature Tirr = 100 K, mim- icking the background temperature of the GC.</sentence><sentence>Due to the SMBH shear, the molecular cloud is disrupted in ≈ 105 yr and, because of its low orbital angular momentum, part of the gas settles in a very small and dense disc surrounding the SMBH (see Fig.</sentence><sentence>3).</sentence><sentence>A fraction of the gas in the disc frag- ments forming self-bound clumps (with density ⩾ 2 × 1012 cm−3).</sentence><sentence>As a combined eﬀect of the initial cloud mass and of the ﬂoor temperature, the mass function of the clumps is top-heavy, ranging between 1 and 60 M⊙ after 4.8 × 105 yr.</sentence><sentence>Figure 3.</sentence><sentence>Density map of the gas in run E of M12 at t = 4.8 × 105 yr.</sentence><sentence>The simulation was projected in the plane where the gaseous disc (at the centre) is seen face-on.</sentence><sentence>The box measures 20 pc per edge.</sentence><sentence>Here we assume that each self-bound clump formed in run E of M12 becomes a star, without accreting any further gas particles after t = 4.8×105 yr1.</sentence><sentence>Thus, we replace each gas clump with a single star particle having mass equal to the total mass of the clump itself, and position and velocity cor- responding to those of the centre-of-mass of the clump.</sentence><sentence>The resulting stellar ring, with a total mass of ∼ 4.3×103 M⊙, is shown in the top panels of Fig.</sentence><sentence>4.</sentence><sentence>The edge-on view shows a small degree of warping.</sentence><sentence>In this paper, we cannot integrate the star particles to- gether with the gas particles, as it would be prohibitive to follow the gas for &gt;∼ 1 Myr.</sentence><sentence>Thus, we substitute the remain- ing gas particles with an analytical potential (Eq.</sentence><sentence>2) very close to the ﬁnal distribution of gas in run E of M12 (see their ﬁgure 10).</sentence><sentence>The total mass of the gas disc within 0.4 pc (i.e.</sentence><sentence>the outer edge of the stellar ring) is ∼ 104 M⊙.</sentence><sentence>For simplicity, the potential is assumed constant in time.</sentence><sentence>While this assumption may seem unrealistic, it is justiﬁed by the fact that the evolution of the ring stars is dominated by the SMBH and the stellar cusp, and the gas disc potential repre- sents a small correction to the total potential.</sentence><sentence>We performed an additional simulation excluding the gas disc potential and we found a very similar evolution for the ring stars.</sentence><sentence>The SMBH is treated as a point-mass N-body particle, similarly to the ring stars.</sentence><sentence>However, given the small number of particles in the simulations, the SMBH would be subject to an unrealistically large motion at the center of the poten- tial well (Merritt 2005), which might aﬀect the dynamics of the stars.</sentence><sentence>For this reason, at each integration step we force the SMBH to remain ﬁxed at the center of the reference frame.</sentence><sentence>1 This assumption is quite conservative for the masses of stars, as it is realistic to expect further gas accretion in run E of M12.</sentence><sentence>c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 4 Gualandris et al.</sentence><sentence>Figure 4.</sentence><sentence>Snapshots of the ring stars at diﬀerent times during the evolution (from top to bottom t = 0, 3, 6 Myr, in a reference frame in which the stars lie in the x − y plane.</sentence><sentence>The star symbol marks the position of the SMBH.</sentence><sentence>3 RESULTS We let the ring of stars evolve for 10 Myr under the eﬀect of the gravitational potential generated by the SMBH, the stel- lar cusp, and the gas disc.</sentence><sentence>Due to the presence of extended mass (stars and gas) within the orbit of each ring star, stars precess in their orbital plane.</sentence><sentence>Because of its much higher mass, the stellar cusp is responsible for most of the preces- sion.</sentence><sentence>While the dependence of the precession time on dis- tance is rather weak (see Fig.</sentence><sentence>2), the dependence on eccen- tricity may be signiﬁcant.</sentence><sentence>This implies a diﬀerent precession time for stars with diﬀerent eccentricity, and it results in a quick loss of coherence in the ring, as can be seen from the snapshots at 3 Myr and 6 Myr shown in Fig.</sentence><sentence>4.</sentence><sentence>Only in the absence of a stellar cusp would the ring evolve coherently.</sentence><sentence>The orbital elements of all stars are shown in Fig.</sentence><sentence>5, at diﬀerent times during the integration.</sentence><sentence>While the semi-major axes distribution remains unchanged during the evolution, the distribution of eccentricities evolves toward a bimodal distribution, as can be seen in Fig.</sentence><sentence>6.</sentence><sentence>While the initial dis- tribution of eccentricities shows a single peak at e ∼ 0.3, the distribution after 6 Myr has a primary peak at e ∼ 0.1 and a secondary peak at e ∼ 0.5, with a tail that extends to about e ∼ 0.7.</sentence><sentence>The cumulative distributions of eccentricities are shown in the insert.</sentence><sentence>We attribute this behaviour to the eccentric disc insta- bility which was predicted to occur in eccentric discs subject to cusp precession (Madigan et al.</sentence><sentence>2009).</sentence><sentence>Due to the fact that f(e) in Eq.</sentence><sentence>7 is a monotonically increasing function of eccentricity, an orbit with initial eccentricity in excess of the average will have a longer precession time, which

therefore cause an increase in eccentricity.</sentence><sentence>The opposite eﬀect will happen to stars with orbits initially more circular than the average.</sentence><sentence>The instability is illustrated in Fig.</sentence><sentence>7, which shows the time evolution of the orbital eccentricity for a random subset of stars in the ring.</sentence><sentence>While stars initially more eccen- tric than the average (∼ 0.3) tend to become more eccen- tric, stars initially less eccentric than the average tend to circularise.</sentence><sentence>The observed timescale for the process is of only ∼ 1 Myr.</sentence><sentence>This is in agreement with the predicted timescale (Madigan et al.</sentence><sentence>2009) Tecc ∼ TNP � Mcusp Mring �1/2 � e � 1 − e2 d de � 1 f(e) ��−1/2 , (8)

Myr.</sentence><sentence>r/ pc ⩽ 0.4 and Tecc ∼ 5 − 10 for a circular orbit.</sentence><sentence>As the ring loses coherence after this time, torques become weaker and changes in the eccentricities become less pronounced.</sentence><sentence>This distribution is consistent with, though not identi- cal to, the one found for the CW disc.</sentence><sentence>Bartko et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) perform a statistical analysis of the candidate disc members, assuming Keplerian orbits in the gravitational potential of the SMBH and the stellar cusp, and derive distributions for the orbital elements of the stars.</sentence><sentence>While these distribu- tions are subject to many uncertainties, the main properties of the eccentricity distribution appear robust.</sentence><sentence>In particu- lar, they report a bimodal distribution for the reconstructed eccentricities with peaks at e ∼ 0.3 and 0.9, though they caution that the high eccentricity stars may not dynami- cally belong to the disc.</sentence><sentence>Once corrected for projection ef- fects, the mean eccentricity in the CW disc is ∼ 0.37, only slightly higher than what we ﬁnd.</sentence><sentence>The diﬀerence is likely due to the eccentricity with which the stars form from the gas disc, which in turn depends on the orbital parameters of the cloud.</sentence><sentence>An average eccentricity of &gt;∼ 0.4 could be produced starting with an even more radial orbit for the molecular cloud, which might result from cloud-cloud collisions near the GC (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Hobbs &amp; Nayakshin 2009).</sentence><sentence>Very large eccen- tricities ( &gt;∼ 0.99) like those found by Madigan et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009), however, seem hard to produce even starting from a more ec- centric gas disc.</sentence><sentence>This has important implications for models of the origin of the S-cluster in the GC.</sentence><sentence>For tidal disrup- tion and capture to occur, a binary must come at least as close to the SMBH as the tidal radius.</sentence><sentence>Madigan et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) ﬁnd that for a 4 × 103 M⊙ disc with initial eccentricity of 0.6 the maximum eccentricity attained by the stars is about 0.9, and yet there are no stars with a pericentre distance small enough to be tidally disrupted.</sentence><sentence>Only discs more mas- sive than 104 M⊙ and with initial eccentricities in excess of 0.6 result in a signiﬁcant number of tidal disruptions.</sentence><sentence>We conclude that the S-stars cannot have formed from a disc like the one produced here.</sentence><sentence>In addition to ﬁnding smaller eccentricities than in some of Madigan’s simulations, we ﬁnd smaller inclinations with respect to the initial ring plane.</sentence><sentence>Inclinations after 6 Myr are generally smaller than ∼ 10 degrees and the maximum we record is ∼ 16 degrees.</sentence><sentence>Inclinations do not seem to correlate Figure 8.</sentence><sentence>Inclinations of the ring stars after 6 Myr of evolution as a function of eccentricity (left panel) and semi-major axis (right panel).</sentence><sentence>The inclination is calculated as the angle between the angular momentum of the star and the z-axis, which is parallel to the initial total angular momentum of the ring.</sentence><sentence>with eccentricities (see Fig.</sentence><sentence>8), though we note that if we divide the sample of stars in two groups, having e &lt; 0.3 and e ⩾ 0.3, the inclinations in the two groups evolve in a diﬀer- ent way.</sentence><sentence>A 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnov test gives probability values of 0.07 at the start of the simulation, 0.01 after 3 Myr and 2.1 × 10−6 after 6 Myr that the inclinations in the two groups originate from the same distribution.</sentence><sentence>This diﬀerence is likely due to diﬀerential heating between more eccentric and less eccentric stars.</sentence><sentence>On the other hand, Fig.</sentence><sentence>8 shows a trend for higher inclinations to develop for stars closer to the SMBH.</sentence><sentence>This is a result of the initial warping present in the stellar ring, which in turn reﬂects the warping of the gas disc.</sentence><sentence>Larger inclinations might originate from more strongly warped gas discs, but additional SPH simulations would be required to test this scenario.</sentence><sentence>The rms inclination grows slowly with time, roughly as t1/8, while the rms eccentricity remains approximately constant at e ≈ 0.3.</sentence><sentence>This scaling is somewhat ﬂatter than what is found in Cuadra et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) and Haas &amp; ˇSubr (2012), and it may be attributed to the diﬀerent initial conditions adopted in this work, in particu- lar to the non zero mean initial eccentricity and/or warping of the stellar ring.</sentence><sentence>The modest inclinations achieved by the simulated stars imply that the single cloud infall scenario cannot account for the high inclination of some of the young stars observed in the GC (those claimed to belong to a coun- terclockwise disc).</sentence><sentence>A cloud-cloud collision has been shown to produce signiﬁcantly warped stellar discs and additional ﬁl- amentary structures at large inclinations with respect to the disc (Hobbs &amp; Nayakshin 2009).</sentence><sentence>Alternatively, the interac- tion between two approximately coeval and highly inclined stellar discs may provide an explanation for the existence of stars at high inclination (L¨ockmann &amp; Baumgardt 2009).</sentence><sentence>Finally, we ﬁnd a very modest heating of the stellar ring during the evolution.</sentence><sentence>This is likely due to the absence of heating from the stellar cusp in our simulations, which would result in an increase in the mean ring height (see e.g.</sentence><sentence>Perets et al.</sentence><sentence>2008).</sentence><sentence>c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 6 Gualandris et al.</sentence><sentence>4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS We studied the evolution of the ring of stars formed in the GC from fragmentation of the gas disc deposited by an in- spiralling molecular cloud.</sentence><sentence>Our calculation is the ﬁrst of its kind to follow, in a consistent manner, both the star forma- tion phase in the gaseous disc and the long term evolution of the stellar disc.</sentence><sentence>We ﬁnd that, while the ring retains the original distribution of semi-major axes, and therefore also the initial inner and outer radius, the distribution of eccen- tricities evolves in time due to the onset of the eccentric disc instability.</sentence><sentence>Torques exerted by other stars in the ring result in a change in the magnitude of the angular momentum and, as a consequence, in the eccentricity.</sentence><sentence>As stars evolve away from the average eccentricity, a bimodal distribution is es- tablished, with a primary peak at e ∼ 0.1, a secondary peak at e ∼ 0.5, and a tail that extends to e ∼ 0.7.</sentence><sentence>This is qual- itatively consistent with the distribution found for the CW disc stars.</sentence><sentence>We predict that a quantitative agreement would require a molecular cloud with an initial orbit more radial than in run E of M12, but a new suite of hydrodynamical simulations is necessary to test this prediction.</sentence><sentence>On the other hand, even a better description of the cloud thermodynam- ics and of the gas shocks taking place during the infall of the cloud might aﬀect the formation and thus the orbital properties of the young stellar ring (see e.g.</sentence><sentence>the discussion in Jiang &amp; Goodman 2011, and references therein).</sentence><sentence>Our simulations support the scenario in which the thin CW disc originated from fragmentation of a moderately ec- centric gas disc resulting from the tidal disruption of a tur- bulent molecular cloud on a low angular momentum orbit.</sentence><sentence>The origin of the WR/O stars at large inclinations, as well as those belonging to the S-cluster, however, seems to require additional physical processes, which are currently under in- vestigation.</sentence><sentence>In the case of the S-stars, relaxation processes against the background spherical cusp of stars and remnants are unable to explain the observed distribution of eccen- tricities within the lifetime of the stars (Perets et al.</sentence><sentence>2009) and diﬀerent mechanisms are required (for a review see e.g.</sentence><sentence>Perets &amp; Gualandris 2010).</sentence><sentence>Similarly, Cuadra et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) have shown that relaxation in the disc does not produce ec- centricities and inclinations as large as those observed for the WR/O stars outside the CW disc.</sentence><sentence>While some outliers may be the result of vector resonant relaxation between the disc and the stellar cusp (Kocsis &amp; Tremaine 2011), several au- thors have investigated the possibility of an additional per- turbing potential, which would produce Kozai-Lidov type oscillations (Kozai 1962; Lidov 1962) in the eccentricity and inclination of the stars.</sentence><sentence>In particular, ˇSubr et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) sug- gest that precession due to the gravity of the circumnuclear disc (CND) at the edge of the SMBH’s sphere of inﬂuence might have driven some of the stars away from the CW disc.</sentence><sentence>An axisymmetric perturbation due the presence of an additional gas/stellar disc, an intermediate-mass black hole or the CND might have observable eﬀects also on the stars in the CW disc.</sentence><sentence>L¨ockmann et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) studied the eﬀect of a second highly inclined stellar disc, while ˇSubr et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) and Haas et al.</sentence><sentence>(2011) considered the eﬀect of the CND.</sentence><sentence>L¨ockmann et al.</sentence><sentence>(2008) found that, in the absence of a stellar cluster, precession and Kozai oscillations due to the presence of a second, inclined disc result in stars achieving high eccentricities.</sentence><sentence>The inclusion of a stellar cusp, however, has been shown to damp Kozai oscillations in the disc (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Chang 2009; L¨ockmann et al.</sentence><sentence>2009), at least in the case of an analytic spherical cusp.</sentence><sentence>In this case, the overall inﬂuence of the cusp can be characterised by a decrease in the ampli- tude of the eccentricity and inclination oscillations, and by a shortening of their period (Karas &amp; ˇSubr 2007; ˇSubr et al.</sentence><sentence>2009).</sentence><sentence>Chang (2009) examined the eﬀectiveness of the Kozai mechanism induced by stellar discs in the Galactic centre and found that Kozai oscillations are suppressed if the pe- riod for apsidal precession induced by the cusp is shorter than the period for Kozai oscillations.</sentence><sentence>In the case of the two disc scenario, the mass of the stellar cusp in the GC is over an order of magnitude larger than the critical mass required to suppress the Kozai mechanism.</sentence><sentence>In general, the damping of the Kozai mechanism de- pends on the parameters of the perturbing potential and on the orbital parameters of the stars, and oscillations might be important for certain sets of parameters.</sentence><sentence>The period of Kozai oscillations can be written as (ˇSubr et al.</sentence><sentence>2009) TK = M• MP R3 P a√GM•a ∼ M• MP �RP a �3 Torb (9) where MP and RP are the mass and radius of the perturbing axisymmetric potential.</sentence><sentence>If the perturber is a second disc at approximately the same distance as the CW disc from the SMBH, RP ∼ a and TK/ TNP ≈ Mcusp/MP.</sentence><sentence>If the perturber is the CND, then RP ∼ (5 − 20)a.</sentence><sentence>In both cases, it seems unlikely that Kozai oscillations might dominate the evolu- tion of the CW disc in the presence of a spherical cusp.</sentence><sentence>The timescale for Kozai oscillations is also typically longer than the timescale for the eccentric disc instability (see Eq.</sentence><sentence>8), suggesting that Kozai oscillations should not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the development of the eccentricity growth studied here, even if this is theoretically possible for certain combi- nations of parameters.</sentence><sentence>L¨ockmann et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) explored the eﬀect of a granular N-body cusp as opposed to an analytic smooth cusp.</sentence><sentence>They found that both a smooth and a granular cusp consistent with the one derived for the GC (Sch¨odel et al.</sentence><sentence>2007) sup- press Kozai cycles in the two disc scenario.</sentence><sentence>However, in the case of an N-body cusp, two-body and resonant relaxation eﬀects may temporarily drive the eccentricty of some stars to large values.</sentence><sentence>This eﬀect is a function of the cusp gran- ularity, i.e.</sentence><sentence>of the mean and maximum stellar masses, and is most eﬃcient in the case of a cusp of stellar remnants.</sentence><sentence>Similar results were obtained by Haas &amp; ˇSubr (2012).</sentence><sentence>It is not yet clear whether secular evolution can play an important role under realistic conditions, i.e.</sentence><sentence>a realistic gravitational potential and granularity of the stellar cusp.</sentence><sentence>Shape and parameters of the potential of an additional disc and/or the CND are not well determined, and the exact composition of the GC cusp is not well known.</sentence><sentence>Further in- vestigation of these issues is deemed necessary and will be presented in an upcoming work.</sentence><sentence>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank the referee Ladislav
