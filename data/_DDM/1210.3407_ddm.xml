      <heading>A metric for determining chemical difference</heading>
    <sentence>We deﬁne a simple metric for quantifying the chemical difference between any two stars δC = NC � C ωC |Ai C − Aj C| NC Where C is a particular chemical species out of the NC species for which abundances have been determined, AC is the abundance ra- tio of element C to Fe relative to solar (i.e.</sentence><sentence>[X/Fe] in standard nota- tion), except when C is Fe, in which case it is the ratio of Fe to H; i and j are the two stars for which this metric is being computed; and ωC represents a weighting factor for an individual species.</sentence><sentence>For this work, ωC is always equal to one, but is included in this deﬁnition for future investigations, when sufﬁciently large data-sets, which will allow its examination, become available.</sentence><sentence>Simply put, δC is the mean absolute difference of species C between two stars across all NC chemical species.</sentence><sentence>There are two reasons for the choice of this type of metric (a Manhattan type) as opposed to a Euclidean type.</sentence><sentence>First and foremost, its use facilitates the separation of clusters in C-space, the ultimate goal of chemical tagging, and secondly, the value of δC is more easily interpreted in the context of abundance measurements.</sentence><sentence>Another advantageous property of this metric def- inition, due to the NC denominator, is that when considering any c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 Quantifying Chemical Tagging 3 number of correlated elements in the summation, the value of δC is independent of the number of number of elements, NC.</sentence><sentence>In this paper, the binned probability density distribution of δC for a single population, normalized to its maximum per-bin δC number density, shall be referred to as the ηC distribution.</sentence><sentence>When such a population contains only members of a cluster, i.e.</sentence><sentence>a single group of coeval stars, chemical tagging theory posits that this distri- bution should occupy the low end of the difference spectrum, while populations derived from strictly distinct clusters will occupy the high end.</sentence><sentence>The following two terms describe these different popu- lations and will be used throughout this text.</sentence><sentence>Their deﬁnitions and uses should be understood as follows: • intra-cluster: All members of this group are conﬁrmed mem- bers of a single open cluster.</sentence><sentence>ηC will be built from those δC com- puted between any two stars that satisfy the above deﬁnition and for which any stated conditions apply (e.g.</sentence><sentence>minimum number of elements, etc.) • inter-cluster: Members of this group are conﬁrmed members of any open cluster.</sentence><sentence>ηC will be built from all those δC computed between two stars that are not members of the same open cluster and for which any stated conditions apply.</sentence><sentence>Figure 1 shows both intra- and inter-cluster ηC distributions for the clusters listed in Table 1, calculated with the condition that a minimum of 8 elements be used in the δC computation (for a de- tailed explanation of this choice, see section 5).</sentence><sentence>We note that the to- tal range of the inter-cluster distribution is much larger than that de- picted, however it is not instructive to display anything beyond the range of the intra-cluster distribution for the purposes of our anal- ysis.</sentence><sentence>It is important also to note that, because we do not assume a cluster is represented by its mean abundances, the inter-cluster dis- tribution takes into account all scatter within a given cluster, across all chemical dimensions.</sentence><sentence>This point is crucial to our analysis, and its potential usefulness in terms of a true chemical tagging experi- ment, in that we wish to determine the ability to distinguish individ- ual pairs of stars.</sentence><sentence>Assuming perfect homogeneity amongst cluster members in this respect would likewise circumvent our treatment of the intra-cluster distribution.</sentence><sentence>2.2</sentence></section>

respectively.</sentence><sentence>A stub of the database is given in Table 3, where CID is a unique identiﬁer for a given cluster in a given study, and SID is a unique identiﬁer for a given star.</sentence><sentence>These iden- tiﬁers make it simple to disambiguate stars with repeated names and clusters from different studies.</sentence><sentence>The complete version of Table 3 is

by hand in some cases where the formats were not as uniform.</sentence><sentence>In very rare cases a literature study that matched our criteria may have proved to be too difﬁcult to parse and load (e.g.</sentence><sentence>a scanned hard copy) and had to be omitted.</sentence><sentence>2.3 The intra- and inter-cluster ηC distributions Upon inspection of Figure 1 it is evident that the two populations have peaks signiﬁcantly separated in δC space.</sentence><sentence>Each peak can be thought of as the “characteristic” chemical difference of that pop- ulation.</sentence><sentence>In other words, based on Figure 1, we ﬁnd that Galactic open clusters, as represented by our literature abundance database, typically differ chemically by ∼0.120 dex, while open clusters’ in- ternal scatter is typically at the ∼0.045 dex level.</sentence><sentence>Next we draw the readers attention to the crossing point of the two distributions at ∼0.07 dex.</sentence><sentence>This represents the point at which a pair of stars would be equally likely to inhabit the same cluster as they would to be members of entirely different clusters.</sentence><sentence>Pairs of stars whose δC computes to the right of this line are then more likely than not to be of distinct origin, while those whose δC computes to the left would be considered more likely to be siblings.</sentence><sentence>Another obvious feature is the bump in inter-cluster ηC close to 0.19 dex.</sentence><sentence>This is most likely due to noise on account of the lim- ited numbers of clusters in this work and would smoothe out if more data were available.</sentence><sentence>The extended tail toward high δC in the 2 Note: To be uploaded to Vizier intra-cluster distribution may also be attributed to noise, perhaps in the form of mis-identiﬁed group members.</sentence><sentence>Another possible ex- planation for these “outliers” is related to errors in their abundance measurements.</sentence><sentence>If not a noise feature, it may represent some form of cloud fragmentation in the progenitor of those clusters, giving rise to multi-modal star formation efﬁciencies within the same molec- ular cloud.</sentence><sentence>In any case, as we shall demonstrate, neither of these features affects the probability analysis in the rest of this paper to any signiﬁcant degree.</sentence><sentence>3 SYSTEMATICS Systematic uncertainties folded into abundance determinations come in many forms.</sentence><sentence>Among these are the methods used in com- puting EWs (and those used to determine continuum levels); the choice of atmospheric models including assumption of Local Ther- modynamic Equilibrium (LTE)/non-LTE calculations and convec- tive overshooting; the synthetic spectrum codes used; and the solar abundance values used to compute relative abundances, to name just a few.</sentence><sentence>In general, an individual study will use identical tech- niques and parameters relating to these factors in order to maintain internal consistency.</sentence><sentence>As such, we do not believe that systematic ef- fects signiﬁcantly alter the intra-cluster distribution computed from our database from the “natural” one.</sentence><sentence>The story for inter-cluster comparison is much more com- plicated.</sentence><sentence>Experience has shown that even with high quality high- resolution data, the latest models and codes and very careful analy- sis, slight differences in approach between studies can yield sig- niﬁcantly different results.</sentence><sentence>Assuming an “intrinsic” inter-cluster ηC with some variance and mean δC, introducing systematics will cause a broadening and a shift in the mean.</sentence><sentence>Searching for an es- timate of the intrinsic distribution, such that adding a systematic treatment will result in an adequate representation of the data, is un- realistic given the complexity of inter-cluster pairs in the database.</sentence><sentence>Systematics, for these purposes, should only affect pairs made from different literature sources.</sentence><sentence>The differing number of clusters and stars per literature source also makes any simpliﬁed treatment im- possible.</sentence><sentence>To gauge the magnitude of both systematic effects, the mean shift and broadening, for the speciﬁc case of our database, we induce uncertainties in the data and extrapolate backward to a best guess of the intrinsic distribution.</sentence><sentence>To accomplish this a Monte-Carlo type of approach was taken, where in each simulation iteration, we added randomly derived un- certainties to the abundances of similar elements for all unique sources.</sentence><sentence>In other words, the same random value was added to all the measurements of a given chemical species in a given litera- ture study, regardless of cluster membership.</sentence><sentence>The absolute values of our randomly derived uncertainties were taken from a Gaussian distribution whose parameters ﬁt the distribution of uncertainties recorded in the database.</sentence><sentence>Figure 2 shows both the literature un- certainties and our Gaussian model, which provides a reasonable ﬁt to the data.</sentence><sentence>The inter-cluster ηC is then computed from this set of simulated cluster abundances and can be compared to the true inter-cluster ηC from our database.</sentence><sentence>We computed 1000 iterations of the systematics simulation de- scribed above and derived ηC across all simulations.</sentence><sentence>The resultant distribution is shown in the left panel of Figure 3 (grey), along with the data (blue), which have been shifted to align the peaks.</sentence><sentence>The broadening due to simulated abundance uncertainties is evident.</sentence><sentence>To reverse this process, or de-broaden, the difference between simula- tion and data is removed from the data to arrive at the green his- c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 6 Mitschang et al.</sentence><sentence>Figure 2.</sentence><sentence>Gaussian ﬁt (red) to the normalized distribution of uncertainties reported in the literature (black histogram).</sentence><sentence>togram in Figure 3, left panel.</sentence><sentence>The grey cross-hatching illustrates the total change between simulations, data and the de-broadened distribution.</sentence><sentence>Addition of the simulated uncertainties caused the mean δC in the resultant distribution to be shifted to a δC 56% larger than that of the original distribution.</sentence><sentence>When corrected for the de-broadened distribution, in order to arrive at an estimate of the intrinsic distribution, we ﬁnd the δC for which a 56% increase ar- rives at the data mean, this results in a peak at δC of ∼0.077 dex shown in the center panel of Figure 3, which is a repeat of Figure 1 using the “intrinsic” inter-cluster ηC instead of the data.</sentence><sentence>This is perhaps a crude approximation, but should nonetheless give an idea of the magnitude of potential effects.</sentence><sentence>The uncertain- ties used, for example, are internal random errors computed in a variety of ways and may not represent the sources of error between studies as well.</sentence><sentence>Speciﬁc considerations, however, are beyond the scope of this work.</sentence><sentence>The bulk shift of our de-broadened distribution likely mis-represents the true rising edge.</sentence><sentence>Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst two, perhaps three, bins shown in the center panel of Figure 3 are proba- bly artefacts of this.</sentence><sentence>Another artefact is visible in the simulated ηC in the left panel of Figure 3 at a δC of ∼0.05 dex.</sentence><sentence>The origin of this feature is unclear, but, given its location, it does not affect our analysis in any meaningful way.</sentence><sentence>Internal, random, errors in abundance measurements will also alter the ηC distributions from their intrinsic proﬁles.</sentence><sentence>Depending on the overlap between clusters in C-space, the magnitude of this effect will be different for either population; however, the scatter induced in the intra-cluster population requires that its magnitude be greater.</sentence><sentence>This implies that the overlap between ηC distributions seen in Figure 3, is an absolute upper limit, and the peaks would be separated by a greater distance in δC, favoring the distinction of clusters.</sentence><sentence>The speciﬁc impact that systematic effects, as discussed here, have on our conclusions in this work will be discussed in fur- ther detail in the next section.</sentence><sentence>4 THE CLUSTER PROBABILITY FUNCTION A major goal of this work is to derive a quantitative assessment of the ability to distinguish coeval stars from those born in distinct en- vironments, based solely on their chemical signatures.</sentence><sentence>The level of homogeneity that is expected within a Galactic open cluster, and the sparseness of the chemical space between them, are readily inferred from Figure 1.</sentence><sentence>We now combine these two concepts to achieve this goal.</sentence><sentence>The probability that a particular pair of stars are members of the same cluster based on their δC is related to the relative contri- butions of each ηC distribution, and can be expressed as Figure 4.</sentence><sentence>The intra-cluster probability function.</sentence><sentence>The black squares and his- togram show the discrete probability function for the same ηC distributions shown in Figure 1.</sentence><sentence>The solid red line shows the least squares ﬁt to this using the continuous function with parameters listed in Table 4, where the dashed cross-hairs represent the 68% conﬁdence limit that a pair of stars are co- eval.</sentence><sentence>Shown in green is the continuous ﬁt for the “intrinsic” inter-cluster ηC derived from our systematics considerations.</sentence><sentence>PδC ≡ prob(δC) = ηintra C ηinter C + ηintra C When computed for the speciﬁc ηC distributions plotted in Figure 1, we obtain the discrete probability function shown in Figure 4, where the cross-hairs represent the 68% conﬁdence limit.</sentence><sentence>Note the steepness of the function; by the time it reaches a δC of 0.1 dex, there is only approximately a 10-20% probability that those two stars are members of the same cluster.</sentence><sentence>This places tight constraints on the performance of a chemical tagging survey (e.g.</sentence><sentence>see Section 6).</sentence><sentence>4.1 A functional form of PδC We now seek a functional form to express the intra-cluster prob- ability continuously as a function of δC.</sentence><sentence>A modiﬁed form of the sigmoid function with four free parameters describes the data well and can be written as prob(δC) = c + 1 − c 1 + aebδC−d The c term accounts for the lower probability limit caused by the tail in the intra-cluster distribution, while the 1 − c term ensures that we do not obtain a probability greater than 1.</sentence><sentence>The solid red line in Figure 4 shows the least squares best ﬁt to the discrete probabil- ity function.</sentence><sentence>The goodness of ﬁt illustrates both the smooth nature of the ηC distributions, and the appropriateness of the continuous probability function.</sentence><sentence>Also shown in Figure 4 is a ﬁt to the probability function from our derived “intrinsic” inter-cluster ηC (see Section 3).</sentence><sentence>This ﬁt (shown in the right panel of Figure 3, along with its discrete coun- terpart) assumed that the ﬁrst bin, corresponding to a δC of zero, or identical chemistries, actually approaches one.</sentence><sentence>Likewise, the sec- ond bin was ignored, both of these under the assumption that they are noise features arising from our crude systematics treatment.</sentence><sentence>The magnitude of possible systematic effects is quite visible.</sentence><sentence>At the 68% conﬁdence level the difference between the two func- tions is ∼0.015 dex.</sentence><sentence>It is difﬁcult to judge whether our “intrinsic” c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 Quantifying Chemical Tagging 7 Figure 3.</sentence><sentence>Summary of simulated

normalized “intrinsic” distribution (green).</sentence><sentence>The center panel shows the “intrinsic” distribution peak-shifted to smaller δC based on the shift from our simulations.</sentence><sentence>The rightmost panel shows the probability function (see Section 4) derived from the “intrinsic” ηC, and ﬁt assuming the ﬁrst two bins are an artefact of this crude

here.</sentence><sentence>The four parameters corresponding to each ﬁt are listed in Table 4.</sentence><sentence>This formulation now provides us with a way of not only ﬁl- tering the results of cluster ﬁnding algorithms, but importantly, a means to report the conﬁdence with which we detect them.</sentence><sentence>There will be a rate of attrition due to the overlap in the respective distri- butions, an effect which is likely due to natural scatter in addition to complex and not well understood processes occurring in the pro- genitors of all open clusters.</sentence><sentence>We stress the importance of arriving at this probability function through empirical analysis of observa- tional data.</sentence><sentence>Until we can be conﬁdent that we fully understand all of the intricacies of star formation and Galactic chemical evolution, this empirical approach will remain the only way to achieve this.</sentence><sentence>This is not to say that the parameters listed in Table 4 are not subject to change.</sentence><sentence>These most likely represent a lower limit to the ability to chemically tag, due to the heterogeneous analysis methods present in our abundance database.</sentence><sentence>In the case of a large scale chemical abundance survey such as GALAH, or Gaia-ESO, a probability function speciﬁc to the analysis methods of that survey would be derived - so long as an appropriate calibration program targeting a number of established coeval populations were adopted.</sentence><sentence>The analysis described in the present paper would be repeated using cluster abundance data from that calibration program.</sentence><sentence>The Gaia- ESO survey serendipitously has this calibration built into its de- sign, since it aims to target 100 Galactic open clusters.</sentence><sentence>Possibly, though not ideally, this could serve as calibration for GALAH.</sentence><sentence>For heterogeneous chemical tagging experiments (without the beneﬁts of a uniform abundance analysis), the most up-to-date abundance data would be added to the literature abundance database and a new probability function derived.</sentence><sentence>In such a way, the function parameters could be iteratively improved.</sentence><sentence>In the meantime, the function with parameters listed in Table 4 represent our current best guess, within the limitations of the abundance data in our database.</sentence><sentence>5 EXPLORATIONS IN C-SPACE Up to this point, all our discussion has been involving the ηC dis- tributions whose δC metric computations were required to have at least a dimensionality of eight (i.e., a minimum of eight distinct el- ements being compared).</sentence><sentence>This is not an entirely arbitrary decision, but one that is based both on the practicality of future chemical tag- ging experiments, and a delicate balance between optimising the cluster probability function and maintaining the statistical signiﬁ- cance of the distributions themselves.</sentence><sentence>Bland-Hawthorn &amp; Freeman (2004) estimated the minimum number of dimensions required to reveal a fraction of the approxi- mately 108 clusters believed to be dissolved in the Galaxy.</sentence><sentence>This ﬁg- ure, between 10-15 elements, has been incorporated into the design of the HERMES instrument for the purpose of the GALAH chem- ical tagging survey.</sentence><sentence>Ting et al.</sentence><sentence>(2012) conﬁrm this number ﬁnding approximately 9 independently varying elements from the available abundance data.</sentence><sentence>The constraint employed here matches well these capabilities, in fact, the mean number of elements in the intra- and inter-cluster ηC distributions came out to be 11 and 9, respectively.</sentence><sentence>In other words, out of the total number of δC pairs in each distri- bution, half were computed with greater than, or equal to, 11 and 9 compatible element

    <sentence>The role of dimensionality on chemical tagging can be tested using the formulation presented here.</sentence><sentence>By relaxing the requirement that a minimum number of species be present in each δC computation we can include the entire database summarized in Table 1, which results in a minimum of 2 and mean of 5.6 dimensions.</sentence><sentence>Figure 6 shows the probability functions derived from their ηC distributions, including continuous ﬁts, and the residuals (both discrete and con- tinuous) obtained by the difference P 8 δC − P all δC .</sentence><sentence>It is evident from the excess in residuals at low δC that the reduction in dimensions results in a signiﬁcant loss in the ability to perform chemical tag- ging.</sentence><sentence>Our ability to explore the same effects for higher dimensions is trumped by the limited sample of studies with a wide range of element abundances.</sentence><sentence>The sharp edge seen in both panels of Figure 5 (at rank 8 and 10 in left and right panels, respectively) illustrates this.</sentence><sentence>The numbers of pairs dramatically reduce and noise immedi- ately dominates our distributions.</sentence><sentence>For example, with a minimum of 10 dimensions imposed, the number of inter-cluster pairs reduces by 80% and the number of clusters being probed cuts almost in half, from 27 to 14.</sentence><sentence>Although it is fairly intuitive at this point to conclude that in- creases in chemical dimensionality lead to improvements in the probability function, it must be noted that improvements, if any, would not necessarily be linear or predictable.</sentence><sentence>The difﬁculty in de- riving abundances for some elements (e.g., weak lines, few lines for EWs, etc.) at a given resolution could yield greater uncertain- ties and potential scatter, resulting in little improvement.</sentence><sentence>Indeed, the limitations on probing higher dimensions in our literature abun- dance database likely are a result of this.</sentence><sentence>Furthermore, elements whose abundance trends are coupled (e.g., see next section) would not singularly lend a comparable improvement over individual un- coupled elements.</sentence><sentence>Figure 6.</sentence><sentence>The effects of dimensionality on the probability function.</sentence><sentence>The top panel shows discrete and ﬁt continuous probability functions for both the minimum 8 dimensions (upper;red) and no limit (lower;blue dotted) ηC distributions.</sentence><sentence>The bottom panel shows residuals computed from P 8 δC −P all δC for data (black histogram) and continuous representations (red line).</sentence><sentence>The strongly positive residuals toward the intra-cluster portion (left-hand side) of the plot clearly speak to the necessity of a larger number of dimensions.</sentence><sentence>Cross-hairs are as in Figure 4.</sentence><sentence>5.2 Probing speciﬁc elements It is now clear that a number of chemical dimensions is required to differentiate clusters in the Galaxy.</sentence><sentence>Each dimension, however, deﬁned by the efﬁciency of its nucleosynthesis in the previous gen- eration of stars, need not contribute evenly to the overall distribu- tion.</sentence><sentence>Elements whose processes are relatively insensitive to stellar mass, for instance, will be generated in most cases and the amount may only depend on a few parameters of the progenitor cloud.</sentence><sentence>We explore the role of individual species in the probability function by recomputing the δC metric for each pair, ignoring that species.</sentence><sentence>The probability function computed from the resulting distributions is then compared to that from the originals.</sentence><sentence>Figure 7 shows the resid- uals obtained by subtracting the new function from that depicted in Figure 4 (red line) and Table 4, for a range of elements with a high ranking (as from Figure 5).</sentence><sentence>Each panel also plots a linear regression to the residuals in the range from 0 to 0.25 (beyond this range the functions become extremely noisy and mostly meaningless), in or- der to illustrate the general trends.</sentence><sentence>In these plots, a positive residual can be interpreted to imply that the element in question contributes above average to cluster differentiation, i.e., abundance homogene- ity is preserved within a cluster while the abundance dispersion between clusters is increased for that element.</sentence><sentence>This is particularly true at the low end of the δC spectrum (i.e.</sentence><sentence>intra-cluster probability greater than approximately the 68% level) where chemical tagging is possible, marked by the vertical dashed line in Figure 7.</sentence><sentence>Typically, for the α and Fe peak elements probed, the level of inﬂuence is average to within the noise, at less than about 1-2%.</sentence><sentence>This is not to say that they are poor chemical tagging elements, only that they act in concert, providing the robustness and noise re- duction of greater numbers of dimensions.</sentence><sentence>The α panel of Figure 7 exempliﬁes this point, where here the combination of Na, Mg, Al, Si and Ca acts as a proxy for the α elements.</sentence><sentence>Although the resultant c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 Quantifying Chemical Tagging 9 Figure 7.</sentence><sentence>Examining the role of chemical tagging species in the cluster probability function.</sentence><sentence>Each panel shows the difference residuals between the function derived in the text and one derived with the particular element, as indicated, ignored in the δC metric computation.</sentence><sentence>For most of the elements listed, the effect is quite small and generally linear.</sentence><sentence>The negative slope, and positive residuals residuals in the low end of the plot without Ba, indicates its power as a chemical tagging discriminator.</sentence><sentence>ηC must suffer from an increase in noise due to diminishing num- bers of dimensions (the total number of pairs is still preserved), it is quite clear that the effect on the cluster probability is signiﬁcant, at greater than the 10% level throughout intra-cluster regime.</sentence><sentence>Fe and Si seem to be exceptions, contributing closer to the 3-4% level on their own.</sentence><sentence>The heavy n-capture element Ba single- handedly alters the cluster probability by close to 8%.</sentence><sentence>Ba can be produced both through the slow and rapid n-capture processes, in low mass AGB (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Busso et al.</sentence><sentence>2001) and core-collapse super- novae (e.g.</sentence><sentence>Kratz et al.</sentence><sentence>2007), respectively, giving a wide range of conditions owing to the observed scatter in disk ﬁeld and between Galactic open clusters (D’Orazi et al., 2009; Bensby et al., 2005).</sentence><sentence>The dependence on age found by D’Orazi et al.</sentence><sentence>(2009) may also be related to its power as a cluster discriminator.</sentence><sentence>Different clusters evolving on different time-spans will exhibit distinct efﬁciencies in Ba production, which are then imprinted on the new forming cluster stars.</sentence><sentence>These possibilities imply that other elements, such as La, Nd and Eu, that form through similar processes, may lend to a signiﬁcant improvement to the PδC ; however, due to the limited availability of their abundances in the literature our sample does not contain sufﬁcient numbers to explore these effects further.</sentence><sentence>We must not discount that non-LTE effects, which may lead to sig- niﬁcant overestimate of Ba abundances in young stars, could be responsible for some of its perceived power.</sentence><sentence>There are many factors conspiring to make meaningful com- parisons for other elements difﬁcult, not least of which is the stark drop off in numbers of pairs for elements beyond those in Figure 7.</sentence><sentence>Provided that there are proper calibrations against known Galac- tic open clusters, upcoming large scale abundance surveys, such as GAL AH, will be highly optimised for these types of investigations.</sentence><sentence>6 CLUSTER RECONSTRUCTION 6.1</sentence></section>

      <heading>Mock chemical tagging experiment</heading>
    <sentence>We have already touched on the fact that the overlap between the intra- and inter-cluster ηC implies that clustering detection efﬁ- ciency can not be 100%.</sentence><sentence>In order to maximise the conﬁdence with which we report detections, we must sacriﬁce potential members in lieu of including non-members.</sentence><sentence>The actual efﬁciency which can be achieved is a function of the area of the overlapping regions between intra- and inter-cluster ηC (see Figure 1), and the conﬁ- dence limit, Plim, set on detections (e.g.</sentence><sentence>68, 90, 98%).</sentence><sentence>In order to establish how said overlap affects the recovery of clusters, and to demonstrate a practical application of the probability function to a group of cluster candidates, we have performed a blind chemical tagging experiment using the abundance database discussed herein.</sentence><sentence>A brief description of the method used follows.</sentence><sentence>δC was computed for each distinct pair of stars, ignoring our a-priori knowledge of cluster membership, thus emulating a true chemical tagging survey.</sentence><sentence>We then identiﬁed all pairs with a proba- bility PδC greater than Plim, where Plim was evaluated at 68, 85, and 90%.</sentence><sentence>Starting with the most signiﬁcant pair of this subset, stars were added to groups where all pairs in the resulting group have at most a δC corresponding to Plim.</sentence><sentence>After addition to a group, a star was removed from the subset of signiﬁcant pairs.</sentence><sentence>When no more stars could be added to the current group, the next most signiﬁ- cant pair was identiﬁed and this process repeated.</sentence><sentence>Grouping was then completed when all pairs of the subset were exhausted.</sentence><sentence>In this method all pairs of members of a candidate group have at most δC corresponding to Plim, as opposed to the group mean.</sentence><sentence>This re- striction ensures we identify the core of a cluster and limits the runaway in linkages that would otherwise occur.</sentence><sentence>This is not partic- ularly sophisticated, and there may be more optimal methods such as evolving the cluster mean as members get added, but it does ensure a strict and invariant interpretation of Plim for our simple experiment.</sentence><sentence>Table 5 summarizes the results of our experiment for Plim of c⃝ 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 10 Mitschang et al.</sentence><sentence>Table 5.</sentence><sentence>Summary of chemical tagging test experiments Plim N Detection Rate Contamination Rate Fragmentation Rate Mean Ndetect Mean efﬁciency 68 16 59% 50% 25% 7.50 42% 85 20 74% 50% 50% 4.85 25% 90 9 33% 22% 57% 4.67 19% 68, 85 and 90%.</sentence><sentence>Here, our deﬁnition of a cluster requires at least three members (e.g., a single high signiﬁcance pair would not be considered a cluster), and a “clean” detection is deﬁned as one where all recovered group members reside in the same true clus- ter (but do not necessarily comprise the whole true cluster).</sentence><sentence>A brief description of the columns of Table 5 follows.</sentence><sentence>N gives the number of clusters detected in total, the Detection Rate compares N to the number of true clusters in the experiment, which is 27.</sentence><sentence>The Con- tamination Rate is a measure of the overall quality of detections and is the fraction of all detections with members from more than a sin- gle true cluster (e.g.</sentence><sentence>not a clean detection).</sentence><sentence>The Fragmentation Rate is the fraction of clean detections that are repeats, a high value of which represents an over-sensitivity to internal cluster scatter.</sentence><sentence>For example, the 57% fragmentation rate in Plim = 90 comes from the fact that out of the 7 clean detections, 5 were made from stars of the same Hyades study, making 4 repeats.</sentence><sentence>Ndetect is simply the mean number of stars in each group, while the mean efﬁciency measures the recovery rate of clean clusters, computed as the number of de- tected members divided by the total number of true members.</sentence><sentence>6.2 Efﬁciency and constraints Table 5 illustrates some of the challenges of chemical tagging and gives an idea of what to expect in terms of efﬁciency and con- tamination.</sentence><sentence>It should be noted, however, that the efﬁciency tabu- lated may not be particularly faithful to a true experiment.</sentence><sentence>Many of the literature studies have low numbers of stars, while the Hyades sample of De Silva et al.</sentence><sentence>(2006) and Paulson et al.</sentence><sentence>(2003) contains 46 members.</sentence><sentence>The stark contrast with little middle ground implies that our numbers likely represent upper bounds, since few clusters would be expected to have only several members, although it is un- clear how Galactic dynamical effects, such as disk mixing, spiral scatter, and radial migration would affect the number of original cluster members expected to be in the scope of a chemical tagging survey.</sentence><sentence>The fragmentation rate is also dominated by the Hyades, primarily due to our requirement of at least three candidate mem- bers per detection, and may represent a lower bound.</sentence><sentence>It is important to understand that the efﬁciency tabulated in Ta- ble 5 does not represent the total efﬁciency of recovering clusters, but rather the per detection efﬁciency of recovering members of a cluster.</sentence><sentence>The total chemical tagging cluster detection efﬁciency is related to at least the detection rate, contamination rate, fragmen- tation rate, and mean efﬁciency combined.</sentence><sentence>A simple calculation for the Plim = 90 case gives a total efﬁciency of ∼2% (0.33*(1- 0.22)*(1-0.57)*0.19*100%).</sentence><sentence>This is an efﬁciency of placing indi- vidual stars in their birth clusters; the efﬁciency of detecting any fossil of an existing association would ignore the mean efﬁciency column and hence for Plim = 90 evaluates to ∼12%.</sentence><sentence>In a million star survey we might then expect to place 20,000 stars in associ- ations.</sentence><sentence>Given the mean Ndetect of 4.67, this would amount to ap- proximately 4300 clusters being recovered in such a survey, to the 90% conﬁdence level.</sentence><sentence>Of course, this is a preliminary number using the literature abundance database, as are all numbers listed in Table 5; a more realistic approximation would only be possible using the PδC cal- culated from a GALAH calibration program as described in Section 4.1.</sentence><sentence>It is also important to note that there is an implicit assumption in this calculation that all stars were indeed born in clusters similar to those that we observe today.</sentence><sentence>Bland-Hawthorn et al.</sentence><sentence>(2010a) sug- gest, based on their chemical evolution models, that clusters in the low metallicity regime, corresponding to early generations of star formation, are more clumped in chemical space, with a wider range of abundance variation between clusters.</sentence><sentence>This would certainly re- sult in a different probability function, leading to higher chemical tagging efﬁciencies, since the literature abundance database used here is restricted to higher metallicities (&gt;∼ − 0.35 dex), due to the metallicity distribution of Galactic open clusters.</sentence><sentence>However, since most stars in the Galactic disk are also in the higher metal- licity range, this effect may not be important for most chemical tagging experiments.</sentence><sentence>6.3</sentence></section>

investigation of this application, and the overall use of PδC , is forthcoming based on a fully blind chemical tag- ging experiment on a homogeneous abundance dataset of several hundred thin and thick disk ﬁeld stars.</sentence><sentence>7 SUMMARY &amp; CONCLUSIONS We have introduced a metric, the δC metric, designed to quantify the chemical difference of a pair of stars in a single context, re- gardless of the number or nature of the measured element abun- dances, between distinct pairs.</sentence><sentence>Using a database constructed from high-resolution literature abundance studies of Galactic open clus- ters, we have analyzed the relative contributions of δC pairs for both intra- and inter-cluster pairs, to arrive at a probability func- tion, PδC , describing the likelihood that two stars share the same evolutionary origin.</sentence><sentence>For the speciﬁc case of a minimum of 8 chemical dimensions, we have derived parameters to a functional form of PδC , whose 68% conﬁdence level (analogous to a 1-σ detection) lies at a δC of ∼0.058 dex.</sentence><sentence>This level, in addition to the steep slope present in PδC , informs the accuracy necessary to distinguish cluster mem- bers from polluting stars.</sentence><sentence>We have probed the effect of variations in the dimensionality of chemical space and the role of individual el- emental species on the probability function.</sentence><sentence>It is clear that limiting the number of dimensions present severely reduces the inter-cluster variations, and thus the approximately nine species prevalent in our analysis are a minimum recommendation.</sentence><sentence>Unfortunately, owing to the difﬁculty of measurement, we could not explore higher dimen- sions.</sentence><sentence>Of the key players, the α elements (by proxy), Fe and Ba particularly stand out, contributing up to 10% of the PδC each.</sentence><sentence>We have placed these results in the context of chemical tag- ging, and shown how they can be used to validate and verify co- eval groups discovered via any means.</sentence><sentence>An important outcome is the ability to determine and report a conﬁdence of detection, based on our observational understanding of Galactic structure as opposed to theoretical models or arbitrary statistical tests.</sentence><sentence>We have utilized this ability to highlight some of the challenges involved in a true chemical tagging experiment.</sentence><sentence>It is evident that the reconstruction of coeval groups of stars, dispersed open clusters, via the technique of chemical tagging is a difﬁcult, but plausible, venture.</sentence><sentence>Even though it is impossible to reconstruct all such groups, and seems unlikely even to discover most, the numbers in Table 5 point to valuable in- formation that can be inferred about what cannot be detected, from what can.</sentence><sentence>They also speak to the advantages of a very large sample of data, given the low efﬁciencies even at low conﬁdence levels.</sentence><sentence>The requirements for internal abundance accuracy of a chem- ical tagging survey such as GALAH can be gleaned from the intra- cluster probability function.</sentence><sentence>However, this function has been de- rived from the currently available set of abundance data in the lit- erature which matched our requirements for resolution, elements, and number of stars, analysed in several different ways between lit- erature studies.</sentence><sentence>With such a heterogeneous sample, considerations of systematics effects must not be ignored, and may result in signif- icant performance loss as discussed in Sections 3 and 4.</sentence><sentence>The func- tion derived in this analysis is only the best guess to date and its use requires understanding the caveats discussed in this text.</sentence><sentence>The results, however, show that the methods introduced here provide a powerful tool for conducting and understanding chemical tag- ging in a practical sense.</sentence><sentence>To achieve the best possible conﬁdence in cluster reconstruction, a chemical tagging experiment of large scale should calibrate against a number of known clusters in order to derive PδC for the speciﬁc analysis methods used therein.</sentence><sentence>Finally, a pipeline recipe for validation and veriﬁcation of co- eval groups of stars detected using element abundances only, has been developed.</sentence><sentence>A logical next step is to use this recipe in a small scale chemical tagging experiment to further develop these meth- ods in a real world scenario, and to demonstrate how the tool En- Link can be applied to this problem.</sentence><sentence>Such an experiment is cur- rently in progress by the authors on a large homogeneous sample (several hundreds) of stars with a wide range of high-resolution abundance measurements.</sentence><sentence>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AWM gratefully acknowledges the
